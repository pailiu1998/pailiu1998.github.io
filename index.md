## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">


I received his undergraduate degree on Software Engineering from Northeastern University, China, where I was supervised by [Prof. Guibing Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YMXJa2EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and is currently a research assistant in the School of Engineering at Westlake University working with [Prof. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). My research focus is on Natural Language Processing(NLP). I plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree in the U.S., and am currently searching for advisors and programs.
